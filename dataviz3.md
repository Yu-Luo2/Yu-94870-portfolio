Q1: I feel confused about total cases, exsiting cases and cumulative cases trend. I can't understand the definition of them. I guess that the cumulative cases trend is the predicted value by prior actual cases number.

Q2: The gragh describe to me that for the fivecountries referred, after a time point,thecumulative cases trend exceeded actual cases number,thus number of confirmed cases is lower than the actual. and I can't realize toal cases and existing cases,because i think toal cases must be higher than the existing ,because it's total.

Q3: Why actual cases number decreased too much fast than the trend. what the definition of total cases and existing cases.
