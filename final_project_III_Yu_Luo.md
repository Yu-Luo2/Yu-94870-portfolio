# Audience
My intended audience is the public. There are no specific criteria. Audiences can be people at different age, from different backgounds and have different occupations, etc.
I choose the public as my intended audience because almost every one heard or at least knew a bit about global warming before. It is not a new topic to us but it is an important one. Also, global warming is a severe and urgent problem that we are facing. Every one who lives on this planet are related to and responsible for global warming after all. Therefore, setting the public as intended audience is an ideal choice for this topic.
Since the intend audience is the pulic, the whole content should be understandable by different types of people. Considering different levels of educatoin and professional knowledge they may have, I tried to make all the words, explanations and data visualizations in the final project to be concise, straightforward and intutive. And I use replace some technical terms with accessible descriptions.

# Summary
## Topic:
At first, I chose to visualized the the relationship between "CO2 Emissions per Capita of Each Country" and "Global Rise in Temperatures in Each Country", and "CO2 Emissions of Each Country" and ""GDP per Capita of Each Country" worldwidely. However, I found that it was very difficult to find complete and accurate data and was also difficult to link the results in a logical way as well as present them well with limited time. Hence, I choose to analyze the data from a specific country - China instead. So my final topic is narrowed down to a more focused case - the CO2 emissions, average temperature and GDP in China.

## Story development:
My initial topic did not have a clear story outline. It was just about visualizing the relationship bwtween the 3 variables of each ocuntry in the world. I had no clue about the background and purposes of the story. After changing the topic to a sepcific region, I had a clearer mind. The story starts with an empirical finding in a paper, and then a new exploration of a specific country based on the finding with updated data as well as new varibales goes on. Followingly, data visualizations of the new data of are illustrated. Finally, conclusions ar drwan on the findings shown in the visualizations and actions to be taken are recommended.

## Reflections and things learned:
1. It is not always the more, the better. I chose worldwide data because I thought it would be more convincing and impressive to use such a large database. However, the result turned to be unpleasing - I could not tell a well-organized and appleaing story with such a large database. Focusing on a much smaller database with data of only one country helps me to form a logical story.
2. Feedbacks are important. Receving feedbacksfrom my friends and families on my work is helpful. They would point out confusing places so that I can improve my work.
