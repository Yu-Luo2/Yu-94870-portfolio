# Comparison between 3 methods of visualizatoion shown above
## Bar chart:
Bar chart shows the contrast of debt-to-GDP ratio among countries in a straightforward and clear way. Each bar represents one country and the value of the ratio of each country is displayed in an ascending order from left to right. However, bar chart cannot show time series data. 

## Grid of line chart:
Grid of line charts display multiple graphs for each country in time order together. Each chart shows changes in debt-to-GDP ratio for a single country from year 1995 to 2019. However, grid of line chart does not show intuitive comparisons among countris. 

## Bubble chart:
Bubble chart can both show trend for each country and comparisons among countries. For this exercise, I group all countries by the continents to limit color and eye travel. Each chart displays the debt-to-GDP ratios of all countries in one year, with the size of bubble representing the value of the ratio. And countries located in the same continent are aligned in the same line and have the same color. To avoid crowdness, I put more detailed information into popups. Healine and subtitle hint at the logic of these charts.
