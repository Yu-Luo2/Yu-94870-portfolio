# Github final project page

# Outline
## Summary:
I want to find out and visualize the relationship between "CO2 Emissions per Capita of Each Country" and "Global Rise in Temperatures in Each Country", and "CO2 Emissions of Each Country" and ""GDP per Capita of Each Country". The expexted result is CO2 emissions brings economic growth, but causes global warming. 

## Structure:
![Explanation of data viz](3.jpg)
Firstly, I will show few global warming examples to draw audiences' attention. 
Secondly, I  will briefly introduce causes of global warming. 
Thridly, I will visualize how did CO2 emissions affect global temperature.
Fourthly, I will show the correlation between CO2 emissions and GDP of each country.
Finally, I will give a conclusion and show the anticipated call to action.

# The data
## Data sources:
https://www.kaggle.com/catamount11/who-is-resposible-for-global-warming (CO2 Emissions By Country.csv)
https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/global-rise-in-temperatures-in-each-country (Global Land TemperaturesBy Country.csv)
https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018 (GDP per Capita By Country.xlsx)

## Plan on using data:
I plan use all 3 data sources listed above. I will extract the data from 1960 to 2014 of variables (Country, Country Code, Year, CO2 Emissions, Average Temperature, GDP per capita) from these 3 files draw plots.

# Method and medium
1. Sort and clean the 3 data sources.
2. Make and write down my own hypotheses.
3. Wireframe a solution, either using pen and paper or Basalmiq (not yet decided).
4. Test the solution with friends and build my solution based on their feedbacks.
5. Use Tableau and Flourish to make data visualizations.
6. Find other materials needed online and organize all materials needed to build my story using Shorthand.
7. Test my Shorthand page with friends and modify.
